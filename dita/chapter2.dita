            <p>"I told you," said Charlie the Choo-Choo.</p>
            <p>"How come I never knew you were alive before?" asked Engineer Bob. "Why didn't you
                ever talk to me before?"</p>
            <p>Then Charlie sang this song to Engineer Bob in his small, gruff voice:</p>

            <p audience="adults">"Say what now? What's this about gobbling children?" Engineer Bob
                asked worryingly.</p>
            <p audience="adults">"Haven't you ever wondered how I'm the fastest locomotive between
                St. Louis and Topeka?" Charlie replied in his small, gruff voice.</p>
            <p audience="adults">"Hmm, well those naughty kids can sure be a pain," said Engineer
                Bob. "Alright then! As long as its just the naughty ones!"</p>

            <p>"Will you talk to me some more when we're making our run?" asked Engineer Bob. "I'd
                like that."</p>
            <p>"I would, too," said Charlie. "I love you, Engineer Bob."</p>
            <p>"I love you too, Charlie," said Engineer Bob, and then blew the whistle himself, just
                to show how happy he was. <i>WHOOO-OOOO!</i> It was the biggest and best Charlie had
                ever whistled, and everyone who heard came out to see.</p>
            <p audience="children">Engineer Bob and Charlie spent many happy days together and
                talked about many things. Charlie was Engineer Bob's best friend.</p>
            <p audience="adults">Engineer Bob and Charlie spent many happy days together and talked
                about many things. Engineer Bob lived alone, and Charlie was the first real friend
                he'd had since his wife died mysteriously, long ago, in New York.</p>
